# Cadmus.Graph

This library represents a enhanced graph mapping tool for Cadmus, bypassing pins and directly using JSON-encoded objects, whatever their type.

Currently this is under development. It will later be integrated in the Cadmus system, which implies:

- removing Graph related components from `Cadmus.Core`.
- adding `Cadmus.Graph` to the API project and using it for automatic mapping.
